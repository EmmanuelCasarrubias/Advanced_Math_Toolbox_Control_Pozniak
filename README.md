# Advanced Control Math Toolbox

Welcome to the Advanced Control Math Toolbox repository inspired by Alexander S. Poznyak's 'Advanced Mathematical Tools for Automatic Control Engineers.' This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of advanced mathematical tools for control engineering.

## Overview

This toolbox is designed to meet the diverse needs of learners and practitioners in control engineering, including:

- Undergraduate and postgraduate students.
- Researchers looking for rigorous mathematical methods.
- Practicing engineers in various industries.
- Designers seeking advanced mathematical tools for their projects.

Our mission is to offer a wide range of mathematical techniques and resources tailored to these audiences.

## Contents

Explore a wealth of mathematical resources, including:

- Algebraic theory of linear systems.
- Lyapunov stability theory.
- Optimization techniques.
- Control of robotic systems.
- Robust and adaptive control methods.
- Optimal control principles.
- Discrete-time and impulse systems.
- Sliding mode control.
- Theory of stability.

And much more...

In addition to the core topics, this toolbox serves as a valuable reference for:

- Probability and stochastic processes in control theory.
- Signal and systems analysis.
- Identification and parameters estimation.
- Adaptive stochastic control.
- Game theory.
